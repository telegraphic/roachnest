ROACHNEST
---------

ROACHNEST is a browser based Graphical User Interface (GUI) for control of CASPER hardware.
It uses bottle.py to serve up web pages, and KATCP to talk to the hardware.

This is still under heavy development. Use at your own risk, and be aware that I've done no 
security checking (so don't run this on the world wide web unless you're crazy).
